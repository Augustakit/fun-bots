bots do not have a player.name causing other mods to break

bots are walking past enemy real players

bot spawns need to be a little more random they tend to be bunched up
--> depends on the amount of bots and amount of paths available. Random = Random ;-)

seems like bots get lost when they wonder off to attack players they cant there way back to path

bot kills dont add to scoreboard
--> not support by VU jet...

Opinons
i need a team function please if not already so from ui can pick which team they spawn to.
some how make bots follow path towards where the fight is (if players are shooting head towards)
