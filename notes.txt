bots sometimes spawn in red zone randomly

bots sometimes wonder off path into red zone like they are following something or?

4 players in server asked one to spawn 50, 30 arrived due to limit click respawn and server crashes

spawning bots more than once sometimes causes crashes

bots do not have a player.name causing other mods to break

bots are walking past enemy real players

bot spawns need to be a little more random they tend to be bunched up

seems like bots get lost when they wonder off to attack players they cant there way back to path

bot kills dont add to scoreboard

Opinons
i need a team function please if not already so from ui can pick which team they spawn to.
some how make bots follow path towards where the fight is (if players are shooting head towards)
