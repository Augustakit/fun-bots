bots sometimes spawn in red zone randomly
bots sometimes wonder off path into red zone like they are following something or?

4 players in server asked one to spawn 50, 30 arrived due to limit click respawn and server crashes

spawning bots more than once sometimes causes crashes

Opinons
i need a team function please if not already so from ui can pick which team they spawn to.
some how make bots follow path towards where the fight is (if players are shooting head towards)
