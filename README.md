Welcome to the fun-bots repository. This is a mod for [Venice Unleashed](https://veniceunleashed.net/) to bring highly configurable and intelligent virtual bots to your Battlefield 3 server.

Do you enjoy our work? Support us on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/funbots)

### SUMMARY!
Quite fun to use bots on different maps and gamemodes!
- Bots can walk around and shoot and attack enemy using grenades, RPGs and other weaponry. [Which maps are supported?](https://github.com/Joe91/fun-bots/wiki/Supported-maps)
- Bots can drive all kind of vehicles (on supported maps)
- Need something a bit more? [Create your own traces](https://github.com/Joe91/fun-bots/wiki/Traces) using an easy-to-use trace manager (press <kbd>F12</kbd> in a game)
- And all this, [highly configurable](https://github.com/Joe91/fun-bots/wiki/Basic-Configuration) to suit your needs using an easy-to-use in-game editor (accessible by pressing <kbd>F12</kbd>).
