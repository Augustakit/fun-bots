bots do not have a player.name causing other mods to break
--> what do you mean?

bots are walking past enemy real players
--> there is a update-Cycle of up to 3 s with 30 Bots. There is no other Way around. If longer than 3s, its a Bug :-)

bot spawns need to be a little more random they tend to be bunched up
--> depends on the amount of bots and amount of paths available. Random = Random ;-)

seems like bots get lost when they wonder off to attack players they cant there way back to path.
--> should actually work. I will test if I can find out what happens

bot kills dont add to scoreboard
--> not support by VU jet...

Opinons:
i need a team function please if not already so from ui can pick which team they spawn to.
--> There are the following options:
    - If you pass a player to the botspawn:
        Config.spawnInSameTeam
    - without a Player (nil)
        Config.botTeam

some how make bots follow path towards where the fight is (if players are shooting head towards)
